# ASU Team Forming Survey Google App Script

## Dev Setup

To develop for this project, `clasp` can be used to write code and push it to the sheet specified in the `.clasp.json` file. In order to get this ID, you can go to a sheet and go to the "Script Editor" window from "Tools" then copy the last part of the URL.

## Backlog

- Add part of the config that will allow hour increments to be chosen
- Add part of the config that allows starting day and ending day to be chosen for the weeks.
- Add part of google sheet that will have the students and IDs
- Survey generation
   - Make it so that the part that asks about choosing other students shows their asurite, followed by their full name in each option.
